Federated Learning system design

This is a repository for my master thesis project. It will encompass the structural and methodical need for a server in a federated learning environment. How it will combine several local models into one functional global model.

Commands to run pipenv:

Note:
This does a user installation to prevent breaking any system-wide packages. If pipenv isn’t available in your shell after installation, you’ll need to add the user base’s binary directory to your PATH.

\$ pip install --user pipenv

Upgrade:
\$ pip install --user --upgrade pipenv

Using the existing pip-environment:
\$ pipenv install

Starting pipenv:
\$ pipenv shell

Exit pipenv:
exit
